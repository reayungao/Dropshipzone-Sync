## 🎯 Overview

This project automates the synchronization of product stock levels from Dropshipzone (Supplier) to WooCommerce (Retailer), preventing overselling and ensuring data accuracy through a safe, file-based integration architecture.

### Core Philosophy: "Safety First"

The system runs **independently** of the WordPress application layer, prioritizing:
- ✅ Server stability
- ✅ Data integrity
- ✅ Strict API rate limit adherence
- ✅ Zero-downtime operations

### Architecture

**Unidirectional Sync:** Supplier → Middleware File → WooCommerce

```
┌─────────────────┐         ┌──────────────┐         ┌──────────────┐
│  Dropshipzone   │────────>│  JSON File   │────────>│ WooCommerce  │
│   (Supplier)    │  Fetch  │  (Middleware)│  Match  │   (Store)    │
└─────────────────┘         └──────────────┘         └──────────────┘
```

## �️ Safety & Identification (Mixed Inventory)

**Critical for stores with mixed products (Dropshipzone + Others).**

This system is designed to be **flexible**. It does not assume every product in your store is from Dropshipzone. To prevent accidental data loss or zero-stocking of your other products, the system uses a **Strict Identification Protocol**:

### How it works
You configure *how* the script recognizes a Dropshipzone product. The script will **ignore** everything else.

**Supported Identification Methods:**
1.  **SKU Pattern:** Matches products starting with a prefix (e.g., `DSZ-*`).
2.  **Product Tag:** Matches products with a specific tag (e.g., `Supplier: Dropshipzone`).
3.  **Brand/Taxonomy:** Matches products assigned to a specific Brand or Category.
4.  **Meta Field:** Matches a custom field value (e.g., `_supplier_id` = `123`).

*This ensures that your other products are completely safe and untouched by the sync process.*

> [!TIP]
> **Best Practice: Use Unique Prefixes**
> If you rename your Dropshipzone products to have a prefix (e.g., `DSZ-12345`), then **matching the SKU is enough**.
>
> If you use "Raw SKUs" (e.g., `12345`), there is a risk of **SKU Collision** (where another supplier uses the same SKU). In that case, you **MUST** use a secondary identifier like a Tag or Brand to be safe.

- **Server Extensions:** `curl`, `json`

---

## 🛠️ Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dropshipzone-woocommerce-sync.git
cd dropshipzone-woocommerce-sync
```

### 2. Create Directory Structure

**Important:** Place scripts **outside** `public_html` for security.

```bash
mkdir -p /home/username/dropship_sync
cd /home/username/dropship_sync
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

**Option A: Zero-Dependency (Recommended for Deployment)**
This project includes a lightweight, manual autoloader in `src/autoload.php`.
*   **No action required.** You can skip `composer install`.
*   The script will run out-of-the-box on any PHP 7.4+ server.

**Option B: Developer Mode (Optional)**
If you wish to install additional libraries or run unit tests:
```bash
composer install
```

### 4. Configure API Credentials

Edit `config.php`:

```php
<?php
return [
    'email'    => 'your_dropshipzone_email@example.com',
    'password' => 'your_dropshipzone_password',
    'base_url' => 'https://api.dropshipzone.com.au',
    'logging'  => [
        'path'        => __DIR__ . '/logs/sync.log',
        'max_size'    => 5 * 1024 * 1024,
        'max_backups' => 5,
    ],
    // ... other settings
];
?>
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Run the Sync

```bash
php run_sync.php
```

**Expected Output:**
```
[2023-10-27 10:00:00] [INFO] Starting Streaming Download...
[2023-10-27 10:00:01] [INFO] Page 1 streamed (200 items).
...
[2023-10-27 10:00:05] [INFO] Success! Inventory saved to .../dropshipzone_inventory.json
```

### Verify JSON Output

```bash
head -n 15 dropshipzone_inventory.json
```

---

## ⚙️ Automation (Cron Job)

Add to cPanel or `/etc/crontab`:

```cron
# Run inventory sync every 6 hours
0 */6 * * * /usr/local/bin/php /home/username/dropship_sync/run_sync.php
```

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

| Component | Permission | Why |
|-----------|------------|-----|
| Directory | `700` | User-only access |
| PHP Scripts | `600` | Read/write by owner only |
| JSON Output | `644` | Readable by web server for Phase 2 |
| Config File | `600` | Contains sensitive credentials |

**Never** place this directory inside `public_html` or any web-accessible location.

## 📊 API Reference

This project integrates with the Dropshipzone V2 API:

### Key Endpoints Used

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/auth` | POST | Obtain JWT token |
| `/v2/products` | GET | Fetch product catalog |

### Rate Limits

- **60 requests per minute**
- **600 requests per hour**

Our implementation enforces 1-second delays between requests (max 60/min).

**Full API Documentation:** See `dropshipzone-api-docs.md`

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Token Expires Mid-Sync
**Solution:** Token cache refreshes at 7 hours automatically. If issues persist, delete `token_store.json` and re-authenticate.

### Rate Limit Errors (429)
**Solution:** Ensure only one instance runs at a time. Check for stuck processes: `ps aux | grep fetch_inventory`

### Incomplete JSON File
**Solution:** The atomic write system creates `temp_inventory.json` first. If the main file is corrupt, check temp file and server logs.

### Memory Errors
**Solution:** Increase PHP memory limit in `php.ini` or script: `ini_set('memory_limit', '256M');`
